# QuizAlarm

## Purpose
Getting up in the mourning is something that many people I know struggle with including myself. This app was made to make it so that people who struggle getting up no longer had to set 5 to 10 alarms in the morning just so that they might be awake enough by the 8th one to get up. Other similar apps already existed however when trying these I noticed that the ones available on disappointing. Many of these apps were riddled with ads and would use bright backgrounds that made it difficult to leave the app running while trying to fall asleep. This app aims to provide an ad free alternative to those apps that also keeps light to a minimum.![image]


## Operating
When you launch the app, you will briefly see a black screen with that says "Quiz Alarm" until the app finishes loading, and the home screen is displayed. Displayed at the top of the home screen is the current time in the format of hour:minute:seconds. Below the time you will see text that informs you on the next alarm that will ring. If no alarms are set the app should simply display "No alarm set." 

At the top right of the screen will be the word alarms in blue text. Tapping this will bring you to the alarms screen. If no alarms have been set the screen should be blank except a button to return you to the home page and a + symbol that will allow you to add alarms. If you press the + symbol you will be taken to a new screen with three different areas allowing you to customize an alarm. The first thing you can do is change the time by clicking on the box with the current time displayed. This will allow you to change the hour and minute by dragging down or up. You can also toggle between either PM or AM. Below that is a text box that will allow you to set a description for your alarm. In the middle of the screen is bar that will allow you to choose between 1 to 3 quizzes, this affects how many problems you will have to solve before the alarm will stop playing noise. Once all changes are completed you can either tap the back button at the top left of the screen to cancel making a new alarm or save the alarm with the save button at the bottom of the screen. Once an alarm has been created it should be displayed on the alarms page. The alarm will be in a new grey box that has the time the alarm will go off and a description below that if one was provided. Alarms can also be deleted from this page by dragging them to the left.

When the app registers that the current time matches the time of an alarm a sound will begin to play, and a math problem will be displayed on screen. The app must be running or else a sound cannot be played. The math problem will be randomly chosen to be division, subtraction, or addition. The answer to the math problem can be typed into text box below the line. The app will not allow you to continue to the next question until the correct answer has been typed in. The number of questions given to you will depend on how many was set for the specific alarm.
